# DITA Community DITA 2 DOCX Open Toolkit Plugin

This plugin uses the Wordinator as the basis for a DITA-to-DOCX transform. It uses the base HTML5 transform to generate HTML that is then the input to the Wordinator DOCX generation process.

## Source Organization

The actual plugin source is in the `plugin` directory. Maven is used primarily to fetch the Wordinator jar so you must have have maven installed and available on your PATH to build the plugin from source.
